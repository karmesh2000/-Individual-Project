                <p>It’s a good institution, especially its small class size max of 35 students. More interactions with the professors and fellow students. It also has 3 campuses, so many chances to socialize during events. Many different types of programs are offered "

                    They have a variety of courses offer to students. Class sizes are smaller than bigger universities easier which would suggest that’s it’s easier to connect and build business relationships. Some professors at the university require attendance in order to receive marks for participation versus others do not. I wish this was consistent throughout the university courses.
